# matTTtrm 🌐

**matTTtrm** is an open-source OSINT framework that helps investigators,
researchers, and cybersecurity professionals **search, correlate, and visualize
publicly available information across countries**.

It works like a **modular OSINT engine**, not a database:
- you provide an input (username, email, domain, company…)
- matTTtrm queries public sources in real time
- results are correlated and visualized

## ✨ What can you do with matTTtrm?

- Find where a **username** exists across platforms
- Correlate **emails, aliases, and domains**
- Explore **DNS, IPs, and infrastructure**
- Query **official business registries** by country
- Visualize relationships as graphs
